<h3>basic algo</h3>
<pre>
In first step, load each cell and build two data structures

* allCells -- lookup map from cell address to cell object
* p2d -- lookup map of precedent to listOfDescendents

These two data structures don't really change structurally, but 
there's a 3rd data structure, a dynamic queue that gets enqueued and dequeued.

In the first step, we enqueue any concretized cell.

In the second step, we dequeue a concretized cell, look up in "p2d" to get its 
descendants. If any of the descendant can now be concretized, it is concretized 
and enqueued.

If the queue is reduced to empty, the entire spreadsheet is concretized. Otherwise, 
there exist cycles.

<h3>QnA</h3>
<pre>
Q: Cell.rpn.precedents duplicates p2d data?

Cell.rpn.precedents is populated in Cell constructor. Subsequently, we use it to update p2d.

buy how is it needed?
