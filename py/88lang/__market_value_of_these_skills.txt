Q: What's the market value of the skills demonstrated in this folder?

-- GTD in a given project
These skills .. seldom needed. 

If a teammate has this skill, then other people could learn it, but they would often stick to what they know i.e. the common knowledge.

-- zbs/expertise, as required in designs.
These skills are minor expertise not ground-breaking expertise with a Wow! effect. 

In this sense, my _PERL_ tricks are similar.

Note some of the content in this folder is low-level zbs, not tricks per seldom

-- IV: mostly not quizzed, but you could showcase them in your answer!

Recall my _PERL_ skills
