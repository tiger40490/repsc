}/* Req: https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/

You are a robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has some 
amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them
is that they have security system connected and it will automatically 
contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into.
