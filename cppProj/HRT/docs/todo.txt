--todo (advanced): stub .. can be postpone or even "discussed in documentation" only

--todo: mv semantics for Order objects saved in map

--todo: also simplify .. not the test fixtures but the main logic?

For now, it's too much work to keep both in-sync
--todo (LG2): remove unused headers

--back burner: 
what's more valuable long-term? coding drill motivation, 
halos like TMP? yes
automated tests for self-assurance, halo and fun?
GTD? no; 
BP? no
--back burner:
put *OrderMsg classes in one file

--todo:
put *OrderParser classes separately?
