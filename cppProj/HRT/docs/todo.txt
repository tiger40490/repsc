--todo: create temp *EventMsg objects on the stack, convert the physical memory location to a byte array and write it to file

--todo: add more unit test
the test on the output file is harder
--todo: also simplify .. not the test fixtures but the main logic?
give up some features like date parsing

--todo: output packet header

--todo (advanced): warehouse and stub .. can be postpone or even "discussed in documentation" only
out-of-order
After processing a buffer, look for the nextSeq in the warehouse. If not found, then wait for next onUDP

--todo (LGpp): separate out header vs implementation files. 
For now, it's too much work to keep both in-sync

--todo (advanced): add some TMP features
--todo (LG2): print timestamp in yyyymmdd, but I can verify it on https://www.epochconvertkjer.com

--back burner: 
what's more valuable long-term? coding drill motivation, TMP, GTD? no; automated tests for self-assurance ?
BP? no
--back burner:
put *OrderMsg classes in one file
--back burner:
put *OrderParser classes separately?

--back burner:
realistically, do I want to implement the warehousing? I feel it's doable but reliable testing would be challenging
