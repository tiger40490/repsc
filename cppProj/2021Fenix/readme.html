<h2> How to build and test </h2>
The bundled run.sh is a bash script tested in windows bash. See Assumptioni 1.
<p/>
I use GCC in c++17 mode. There's no tweak in my GCC.
<p/>
main() has a bunch of tests you can uncomment and run. I usally run each test by itself.  
<p/>
For the last test (using 2 files), full output is printed to stderr. You can filter out everything else:
<pre>
   ./a.out  1>/dev/null
</pre>
<h2> Assumptions </h2>
<ul>
<li> Assumption 1 -- (based on experience) -- linux would work. I have no linux access at home. My run.sh worked fine with g++ in windows bash. Based on my experience linux would work, too.
<li> Assumption -- (based on mathematical reasoning): At any moment I (the photon) can be "affected" by at most 3 mirrors. Even though I can be "near" 8 mirrors.
<li> Assumption -- Each cell is assumed to be 1 meter by 1 meter. This simplies all discussion/documentation.
<li> Assumption -- a grid will have some mirrors, never empty.
<li> Assumption -- the mirror locations are unique in the input file. No validation needed against duplication. Therefore a std::list or std::vector is good enough, rather than a set.
<li> Assumption -- ascii file parsing is a commodity skill, not a differentiating skill of a c++ developer, and doesn't deserve lots of effort (hours) in this assignment. I have coded the minimum in terms of line parsing. Given more time, we could find a file parser utility to simplify this task.
</ul>

<h2> Scenarios, when I (the photon) get absorbed or deflected </h2>

Each scenario has a runnable test in main.cpp.

<ul>
<li> Scenario T -- am inside the grid.. am directly adjacent to a mirror, perhaps with 1 or 2 diagonal mirrors. These mirrors face me like (Ameriican football) guard-center-guard. I will be make direct hit and get absorbed. Those diagonal mirrors are actually irrelevant (won't lose points).

<li> Scenario Y -- am inside the grid... am diagonally adjacent to two mirrors symmetrically. Both would lose points.

<li> Scenario / -- am inside the grid... am diagonally adjacent to exactly one mirror 

<li> Scenario TOE (i.e. T-on-edge) -- am outside the edge, and facing three (or two) neighbouring edge cells lined up like Scenario T. Can be treated as Scenario T.

<li> Scenario E -- am outside the edge, and making an entry right next to one (or two/ edge mirror. All relevant mirrors will lose points.
<li> There's also the happy scenario -- am unaffected by any mirror, so I move forward one cell, keeping my momentum. Like in all scenarios, I may hit an exit cell.
</ul>

<h2> Algorithm </h2>
At any snapshot moment, I (the photon) is in a particular cell, moving in one (of four possible) direction. 
<p/>
Every surviving mirror (i.e. not expired) is some distance away. If we compute those distances, there are only up to three mirrors within 1.4143 meter. Together they decide my next position (the cell and direction).

-- todos:
add visualization but don't need to send updated code
create a few test cases on a 5x5 grid. Randomiz the rays
If all tests pass, then we can send visualization output as evidence that "all tests passed"
