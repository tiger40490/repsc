Don't care about the hours taken.

Q: do we need a Board class to hold the list of mirrors and the size? 
It would require a Board.h... Is it overkill?

<h2> Assumptions </h2>

Assumption: At any moment I (the photon) can be "affected" by at most 3 mirrors. Even though I can be "near" 8 mirrors...

Assumption: Each cell is assumed to be 1 meter by 1 meter. This simplies the discussion/documentation.

<h2> Scenarios </h2>
Scenario T: am not on the edge, and adjacent to a mirror, perhaps with 1 or 2 diagonal mirrors. All mirrors side by side.

Scenario Y: am not on the edge, and diagonally adjacent to two symmetrical mirrors

Scenario /: am not on the edge, and diagonally adjacent to exactly one mirror 
Scenario (minor): If two adjacent edge cells both have mirrors ...

<h2> Design (... priorities ...) </h2>
At any snapshot moment, I (the photon) is in a particular cell, moving in one (of four possible) direction. 
Every surviving mirror is some distance away. 
If we compute those distances, there are only up to three mirrors within 1.42m. 
Together they decide my next Position (the cell and direction).

This free-standing function can be a method (no need to return...), can be tested independently. It requires my current cell (I will pass in a Position) and up to 3 mirrors, and also the board dimension as a global var

If I'm outside the board, then the logic is slightly different. LGpp.

A wrapper function would provide the entire survivingMirror population..

A Position type includes my current cell and a direction. Direction can be a pair.. (1,0) means increase rowId...
