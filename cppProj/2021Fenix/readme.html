Scenario: if two adjacent cells (not edge cells) both have mirrors ..

Assumption: At any moment I (the photon) can be "affected" by at most 3 mirrors. Even though I can be "near" 8 mirrors...

Assumption: Each cell is 1m by 1m.

<h2> Design priorities </h2>
At any snapshot moment, I (the photon) is in a particular cell, moving in one (of four possible) direction. 
Every surviving mirror is some distance away. 
If we compute those distances, there are only up to three mirrors within 1.42m. Together they will decide my next location.
