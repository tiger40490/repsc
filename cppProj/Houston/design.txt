--algorithm and data structure--
Engine1 uses a red-black tree to hold stats per symbol.
Engine3 uses a 3-D array to hold the same. If symbols are four-characters then 4-D. Engine3 can support up to 13-D.

For each symbol, we keep only 5 statistics, as defined in PerSymbol struct. Therefore, memory footprint is approximately the number of symbols times the 5 fields. This estimate applies to Engine1. Engine3 uses possibly more memory but is faster than balanced binary search tree or hashtable. 

Engine4 is not implemented but addresses the limitations of Engine3. Please find the detailed documentations in the header files.

--numeric test--
See AbstractEngine::simpleTest() function. It uses one symbol and verifies the weighted average calc and other calculations.

--command interface--
The engine will listen to commands on stdin. The attached command.txt lists the commands used in my test.

Administration command interface is extremely useful in real time trading and market data engines.

--additional data fields in the future--
It is very likely to get more than 5 data fields in a future csv. The current designs can support average, moving average, sum, max/min. I think variance, volatility, median will be hard to support in the current design.

--Asynchronous data loading --
startThread() is an experimental feature. If the input file is large and takes a while to load, then it can be run on a worker thread. The main thread can process other commands such as print stats.

However, a key concurrency flaw in the current implementation of VWAP is inconsistency between cumVol vs cum$vol. The query thread may see a new cumVol but an old cum$vol number, and compute an invalid VWAP number. 

One solution is mutex, a real drag on the tickfile() function. An optimistic locking might be better.

--Trade-offs--
See comments on top of Engine3 class.

--time spent-- 
2H for the Engine1 + Engine3

The automated testing and documentation took additional one hour.

The asynchronous functionality took additional one hour.

--git repo--
I have no time to install and learn git at the moment.
