# The hook should Use q[exit] with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the commit.
# The --no-verify option to git commit bypasses the pre-commit hook when committing

# Based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19387073/how-to-detect-commit-amend-by-pre-commit-hook
# * If head is strictly ahead  (eg: child) of  $upstream, this hook is quiet.
# * if head is strictly behind (eg: parent of) $upstream, this hook would rightly complain.
# * if head is same as $upstream, then --amend vs regular append are _indistinguishable_ so this hook has to "err on the side of caution" and prompt user to confirm.
# Risk in "Amend" scenario is too high, much higher than the inconvenience of "Append" scenario.
# The inconvenience is a necessary evil -- all my git hooks are.
