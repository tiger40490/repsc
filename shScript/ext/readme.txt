This directory holds site-extension files, which depend on base files.
There are now a small number of base files, and a growing number of site-extensions.

Eg: append.bashrc_winMlp+mlp.txt is an extension for site "mlp", extention over the base file "append.bashrc_winMlp", which is itself a customized replacement of append.bashrc_win

Witout extension framework, append.bashrc* file naming had grown messier over the years.
